# ConfigManagerPlus Demo

This console application demonstrates how to use **ConfigManagerPlus** with JSON, YAML, INI and `.env` files, environment variables and command-line overrides. It also shows hot reload, typed getters, validation and section binding.

Run the demo (once the .NET SDK is installed) with:

```
dotnet run --project Demo
```

Edit any of the configuration files while the app is running to see hot reload in action.
